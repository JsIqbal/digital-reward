# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Explained

Hey there! Imagine you're building the coolest video game ever. Well, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is like creating that game world in a smart and organized way. Let's dive in!

## What's DDD All About?

Think of DDD as a super guidebook for making your game. Here's the deal:

-   **Domain:** This is your game world, with all its characters, places, and rules. Just like the world in your favorite game!
-   **Model:** Imagine it as a special book that helps you remember who's who and what's what in your game.
-   **Bounded Contexts:** Picture different zones in your game, like a spooky forest or a magical castle. Each zone has its own rules and characters.
-   **Entities:** These are like the main heroes and villains in your game. They can change and learn new things.
-   **Value Objects:** Think of them as special treasures, like a powerful sword or a healing potion. They're super helpful!
-   **Aggregates:** Imagine a group of characters and treasures working together. It's like a superhero team with awesome powers.
-   **Repositories:** These are like magical chests where you keep your characters and cool stuff. You can easily find them when you need them.
-   **Services:** Think of them as expert helpers in your game. They do important tasks, like casting spells or fixing things.
-   **Ubiquitous Language:** It's like if everyone‚Äîplayers and characters‚Äîused the same words. This makes everything easier to understand!

## How Does DDD Work?

1. **Layered Architecture:** Imagine your game as a yummy cake with different layers. Each layer does something special, like showing the game to players or making characters move.
2. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):** This is like having a secret clubhouse for all the game's magic. There are doors (adapters) that let things go in and out.
3. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** It's like having separate notebooks‚Äîone for writing stuff and one for reading stuff. This keeps the game organized.
4. **Event Sourcing:** Imagine writing down every adventure in a special book. Instead of saving the game at one point, you can read the book and know everything.
5. **Aggregate Roots:** These are like the leaders of different groups in the game. They make sure everyone follows the rules.
6. **Domain Events:** Think of these as special announcements in the game. When something cool happens, everyone gets to know.

## Why Use DDD?

-   DDD helps make software as exciting and real as an awesome video game!
-   It makes software easier to understand because everything is neat and organized.
-   It's like crafting a magical world where everything works together perfectly.

## Challenges of DDD:

-   Learning DDD might take some time because it introduces new ideas.
-   At the start, planning and understanding the game world might need more time.
-   Finding the right balance between accuracy and practicality can be a bit tricky.

Domain-Driven Design is a bit like creating an epic adventure that's fun for both players and creators. Just like your favorite game, DDD helps build software worlds that are amazing, consistent, and a whole lot of fun for everyone! üöÄ

# Project Architecture

Welcome to the world of software architecture! üöÄ This document will guide you through the different parts of your project and explain each one in a fun and relatable way. Imagine your project as a big playground, and each folder and component is like a player or equipment that contributes to the game.

## Main Folder: Your Project's Home üè°

This is where everything starts! Just like how a game starts from a central place, your project starts from here. It's like the entrance to a big playground, and all the fun begins when you step in.

## cmd Folder: Where the Main Game Plan is Written üìú

Think of this as the place where the game plan is written. It's like someone giving instructions on how to play. "Start the game, set up everything, and let the fun begin!" This folder contains the instructions that your project needs to follow.

## config Folder: How the Game Will Be Played üéÆ

Here, you decide how the game should be played. Imagine you're setting up the rules, like which colors are good, how fast players can run, and other settings. The config folder is where you adjust your project's settings and make sure everything is just right.

## database Folder: Getting Ready for the Game üèüÔ∏è

This is like the part of the playground where you prepare everything before the game starts. You set up the swings, slides, and all the fun stuff needed for the game to happen. The database folder is where you get everything ready for your project to run smoothly.

## repo Folder: Helpers for Playing the Game ü§ù

Think of this as your helper friends who know all the rules of the game. They help you keep track of scores, who's playing, and other important stuff. The repo folder holds the code that helps your project interact with the data it needs.

## rest Folder: Where People Play the Game üèüÔ∏è

Imagine this as the game field itself! People come here to play the game. They run, jump, and have fun. In the rest folder, you manage how people can play together. This is where the different parts of your project connect and interact with each other.

## svc Folder: Managing the Game üéÆ

This is like the person who makes sure everything is going well in the game. They decide if someone wins, if the game is fair, and if everyone is happy. The svc folder contains the important logic that keeps your project running smoothly and ensures things work as expected.

## models Folder: Characters and Stuff in the Game üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Imagine this is where you create all the characters for your game. Like the heroes, villains, and other cool stuff you can use to play. In your project, the models folder holds the data structures that represent the different things your project works with.

## cache Folder: Remembering Important Stuff üìö

Just like how you remember where you left off in a game, the cache folder helps your project remember things quickly. It's like a super-fast memory that stores important information so your project can use it again later.

## logger Folder: Keeping a Diary of the Game üìñ

Imagine having a diary where you write down what happens in the game. The logger folder is like a diary for your project. It keeps a record of what's happening, so you can go back and check what went right or wrong.

## docs and util Folders: Guides and Extra Helpers üõ†Ô∏è

The docs folder is like the guidebook for your game, where you explain how everything works. The util folder is like a toolbox with extra tools that your project can use whenever it needs them.

---

## Directory Structure

Your project's structure looks like this:

-   root
    -   cmd/
    -   config/
    -   rest/
        -   user/
        -   server.go
    -   svc/
        -   userrepo/
        -   service.go
    -   repo/
        -   user.go
    -   cache/
    -   logger/
    -   docs/
    -   util/
    -   main.go

## Components

### rest

This is where the fun begins! Different parts of your project come together here to play the game.

### svc

Here's where the magic happens! The svc folder manages the game and ensures everything works smoothly.

### repo

The repo folder helps your project interact with data, just like your helper friends in the game.

### config

This folder sets the rules and settings for your game. It's like giving instructions on how to play.

### main.go

This is like the button to start the game. When you press it, your project starts running.

## Usage

To start the game (your project), run `go run main.go`.

## Notes

-   Always handle errors and validations in your code to keep the game fair.
-   Use clear and consistent naming for your packages and functions.
-   Feel free to add more details as your project grows and evolves.

# NGROK Docs:

1. ngrok web login
2. download ngrok and run it
3. get the authToken from ngrok web account & run :

ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

4. execute : ngrok http YOUR_LOCAL_PORT

    - start ngrok task:

        - ```cmd
          ngrok http <PORT>
          ngrok http 3004
          ```

        ```

        ```

    - kill ngrok task:
        - find task list using :
        ```cmd
        tasklist | find "ngrok"
        ```
        - kill task :
        ```cmd
        taskkill /F /PID <pid>
        ```
        - kill all task :
        ```cmd
        taskkill /F /IM ngrok.exe
        ```

## DB Architecture

-   There will be 3 tables
-   A user table: user_id, email
-   A product table: product_id, product_name, product_description, product_price
-   A user product table naming user_prod: user_id, product_id

## Swagger Documentation:

-   go to the bin folder of GO path and :
    ```bash
    go install github.com/swaggo/swag@latest
    ```
-   execute swag init inside the server or your backend project
-   donload swagger from : https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui
-   Take the dist folder from the swagger downloaded file and keep inside the projects docs folder
-   take the index.html file outside the dist folder and keep inside docs directory
-   This is the setup file for the index.html file:

    ````html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />
            <title>Swagger UI</title>
            <link
                rel="stylesheet"
                type="text/css"
                href="./dist/swagger-ui.css"
            />
            <link
                rel="icon"
                type="image/png"
                href="./dist/favicon-32x32.png"
                sizes="32x32"
            />
            <link
                rel="icon"
                type="image/png"
                href="./dist/favicon-16x16.png"
                sizes="16x16"
            />
        </head>

        <body>
            <div id="swagger-ui"></div>
            <script src="./dist/swagger-ui-bundle.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
            <script
                src="./dist/swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js"
                charset="UTF-8"
            ></script>
            <script>
                const ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
                    url: "./swagger.json", // Path to swagger.json or swagger.yaml
                    dom_id: "#swagger-ui",
                    deepLinking: true,
                    presets: [
                        SwaggerUIBundle.presets.apis,
                        SwaggerUIStandalonePreset,
                    ],
                    layout: "StandaloneLayout",
                });
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```
    ````

-   Go to the server.go file and initialize the router for the documentation like this:

    ```code
    router.Static("/docs", "./docs")
    ```

-   write the documentations for the controllers and after each documentation execute comand:
    ```bash
    swag init
    ```
